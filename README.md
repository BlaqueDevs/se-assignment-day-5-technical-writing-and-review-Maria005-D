c) Makes Information More Engaging
     Keeps the Audience Interested: Visuals and examples break up the monotony of text-heavy content, making the material more engaging. People are more likely to pay attention when 
        information is presented in varied formats.
     Example: If you’re explaining how a website is built, you could include a diagram that shows the structure of the website and then provide an example of how the layout works in 
      practice.
    Why It Works: The combination of text, example, and visuals keeps the reader engaged and helps reinforce the material in a more dynamic way.
d) Provides Context and Clarifies Terminology
    Makes Abstract Terms Relatable: Complex terms or jargon can be confusing without context. Examples and visuals give these terms context and make them easier to understand.
    Example: If you’re explaining the concept of "machine learning", you could provide an example like “Imagine teaching a computer to recognize photos of cats. You feed it thousands of 
      images labeled ‘cat’ or ‘not cat,’ and over time, it learns to identify cats on its own.”
    Why It Works: The example helps readers relate to the concept of machine learning without needing technical expertise to understand it.
e) Helps with Retention
   Reinforces Memory Through Visuals: Studies show that people remember visual content much better than text alone. Combining examples with visuals helps solidify the information in the 
   reader's memory.
   Example: In a software tutorial, instead of just explaining how to use a tool, provide a screenshot of the interface with labeled buttons and icons.
